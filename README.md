# EVOLTask

### Description

EVOLTask is a computational framework for the discovery, exploration, and modeling, of task-specific human motor coordination strategies. The framework is formalized using a systems-based context, emphasizing the notion of coordination of human movement as a dynamical, emergent phenomenon, and through its implementation it integrates concepts from biomechanical and neurophysiological models of motor behavior. 

Specifically, it uses evolutionary optimization to explore task-specific configuration space(s) with the goal of discovering sets of coordination strategies that lead to successful task performance.
